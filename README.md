# Python_Cryptography_Test (Affine Cipher)
This program determines the validity of a password.
A key feature of the program is that it does not contain the password itself.
I believe this is an affine cipher, but it does not include Euclid's algorithm.

Much to my chagrin, I do not remember what the password is.
I could determine it, however, by doing a detailed analysis of the code.
